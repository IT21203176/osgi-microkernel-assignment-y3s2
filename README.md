## Project Description  
**AutoBuddy** is a vehicle service management platform built around the **OSGi framework**, following the microkernel architecture pattern. The system integrates four distinct producer-consumer scenarios:  

1. **Administrative Service**:  
   - Customer registration and technician hiring.  
   - Transactional calculations for service management.  

2. **Test Center Service**:  
   - Conducts vehicle tests as requested by customers.  
   - Compiles detailed reports and maintains test histories.  

3. **Inventory Service**:  
   - Enhances vehicle functionality by adding spare parts.  

4. **Mechanical Service**:  
   - Oversees vehicle repairs and maintenance, tailored to customer needs.  

After the service process, customers can complete payments and receive detailed, printable receipts.

## Individual Contribution: Test Center Service  
This component is implemented using the **OSGi framework** to enable a service-oriented architecture. It is divided into two main components:  

### 1. **TestCenterServicePublisher**  
![Picture2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e453e34b-74af-40d4-add9-c7950bc6e816)

- **Purpose**: Publishes services for vehicle testing.  
- **Features**:  
  - Displaying and selecting test reports.  
  - Managing report history.  
  - Printing test reports and exporting data to CSV.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - `testCenterServiceImpl`: Handles core functionalities using `ArrayLists`.  
  - `testCenterServiceActivator`: Initializes the bundle context and registers services.  

### 2. **TestCenterServiceSubscriber**

- **Purpose**: Acts as the client-side interface to access published services.  
- **Features**:  
  - Vehicle testing and checklist viewing.  
  - Retrieving report history.  
  - Exporting data in CSV format.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - `testCenterServiceActivator`: Establishes communication with the publisher to access services.

## Manifest Implementation  
### Components:  
- **TestCenterServicePublisher**  
- **TestCenterServiceSubscriber**  

These components are deployed and executed in the **OSGi framework** using bundle commands.
